# CORTEXX

_== WIP ==_

## About

This project currently exists as a way to enhance my own development experience while doubling as a useful tool for myself.

## Notes

1. Create a `secrets.env` file at the root of the project directory (same directory that contains `.env`) and add the following Environment Variables:
   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`=_the password the project should use_
   - `REACT_APP_JWT_SECRET`=_a secret to be used by the JSON Web Token_ 

## How to Run

1. Download Docker-Compose if you do not have it already
2. From this folder, run `docker-compose up --build`
3. Once complete, navigate to `http://localhost`
